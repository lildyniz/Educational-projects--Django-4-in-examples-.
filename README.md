### Educational projects based on the book "Django 4 in examples".

#### As I studied the book, I delved into the described technologies and practiced writing proposed projects.

##### In the process of studying, I came across a lot of mistakes and misunderstandings, but gradually I understood what was what and how to solve this or that problem. 
This is what allowed me to learn new things and explore Django, DRF, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery, Docker, Docker-compose, etc.
